# Quick start on Google Colab

1. Create a new notebook on Google Colab
2. Run the following command (2 lines) in a Code cell to install this extension.

        !source <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/conjure-cp/conjure-notebook/v0.0.8/scripts/install-colab.sh)
        %reload_ext conjure

3. In the following Code cells Conjure commands will be available.

See a very simple example here: [What_number_am_I?](https://github.com/ozgurakgun/notebooks/blob/main/What_number_am_I%3F.ipynb)

There are a few other simple examples in the [ozgurakgun/notebooks](https://github.com/ozgurakgun/notebooks) repository.

# Quick start on Jupyter Notebooks

You do not have to use Google Colab to use Conjure Notebook. Currently we do not provide a script to install it on a pure Jupyter environment. Please have a look at the [scripts/install-colab.sh](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure-notebook/blob/main/scripts/install-colab.sh) to see the steps.

## Making a release

Run `scripts/make-release.sh old-version new-version` from the root of this repository.
